\title{Get standardized Pristine Seas Google Drive paths}
\usage{
ps_science_paths(mustWork = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mustWork}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the function errors when the SCIENCE
folder is not found. If \code{FALSE} (default), a warning is issued and a
best-guess path is returned.}
}
\value{
A named list with normalized paths:
\describe{
\item{science}{Path to \code{Pristine Seas/SCIENCE}}
\item{datasets}{Path to \code{SCIENCE/datasets}}
\item{expeditions}{Path to \code{SCIENCE/expeditions}}
\item{projects}{Path to \code{SCIENCE/projects}}
}
}
\description{
Returns normalized local paths to the Pristine Seas Science Google Drive
folder structure:
}
\details{
\preformatted{
My Drive/
└── Pristine Seas/
    └── SCIENCE/
        ├── datasets/
        ├── expeditions/
        └── projects/
}

The function works on Mac and Windows and avoids hard-coded user paths.

Path resolution order:
\enumerate{
\item If the environment variable \code{PS_SCIENCE_PATH} is set, it is used
as the SCIENCE folder.
\item Otherwise, the function detects the local Google Drive "My Drive"
directory and searches for \code{"Pristine Seas/SCIENCE"}.
\item If multiple matches exist, an \code{ngs.org} account is preferred.
}

This function requires Google Drive for Desktop with the
\code{Pristine Seas/SCIENCE} folder synced locally.

For non-standard setups (e.g., custom drive letters, CI, or shared machines),
set an environment variable in \code{.Renviron}:

\preformatted{
PS_SCIENCE_PATH=G:/My Drive/Pristine Seas/SCIENCE
}

All returned paths use forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility.
